# ElectraWiFiBoard

A PCB which enables connecting an Electra air conditioner to internet using a Wemos D1 mini esp8266 module

The circuit is based on the [ElectraWiFi](https://github.com/giladger/ElectraWifi) repository by [giladger](https://github.com/giladger) which contains code for this project

I designed it using KiCad
